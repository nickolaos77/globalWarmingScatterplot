This is a simple scatterplot showing the global temperature from 1753 to 2015 
using the D3.js library.

D3 Notes

1. The order of the elements appended on svg is very important and can cause
strange behaviour if it is not the correct one.


2. Hovering over a rectangle causes the appearance of a tooltip
In this project I extended the functionality of the tooltip I created
in my previous D3.js project (dopingInProfessionalCycling) by changing 
the position of the tooltip to position it close to rectangle being hovered.
The other details are similar to those of the previous project
